# Twheatmap

I wrote this code back in college as part of the requirements for my Master's
Degree in Instructional Psychology and Technology.

The idea was to take a set of tweets representing the memorable or
impactful quotations from a public address and overlay them onto the text of
the address to create a heatmap.

We called it a form of "collaborative notetaking".

It's here for historical rather than practical reasons, although it
might be fun to dust it off and try it out again.
